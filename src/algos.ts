    a:  "A* pronounced A-Star was originally created in an attempt to create a general purpose robot as part of the Shakey\
     project in the 1960’s and 70’s. A* is a best-first search algorithm.\
     \nRuntime: \
    \nThe time complexity is polynomial when the search space is a tree, there is a single goal state,\
     and the heuristic function h meets the following condition:\
    \n| h ( x ) − h ∗ ( x ) | = O ( log ⁡ h ∗ ( x ) ) \
    \nwhere h* is the optimal heuristic, the exact cost to get from x to the goal.\

    BFS: "Breadth-First Search is a graph or tree traversing algorithm that looks at all nodes at the current level \
    before moving onto the next deepest set of nodes. It was created by Konrad Zuse in 1945 and later reinvented by Edward F. Moore in 1959. \
    \nRuntime:\
    \nO( | V | + | E |) where V is the number of nodes and E the number of edges.\

    DFS: "Depth-first search is a pathfinding or tree spanning algorithm that follows one branch to its deepest point before backtracking. \
    It was created in the 19th century by French mathematician Charles Pierre Trémaux. \

        It uses a min-priority queue to find the shortest path of a weighted graph. \
